_What is a Region? What is an AZ ?_

A Region is a geographical area. Each Region consists of 2 (or more) Availability Zones. An Availability Zone(AZ) is simply a Data Center.

An AZ is one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking and connectivity, housed in separate facilities.


_What is an Edge Location ?_

Edge Location are endpoints for AWS which are used for caching content. Typically this consists of CloudFront, Amazon's Content Delivery Network (CDN).
